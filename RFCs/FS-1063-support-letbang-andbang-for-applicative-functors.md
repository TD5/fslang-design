# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Extend computation expressions to support applicative functors via a new `let! ... and! ... return ...` syntax.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Applicatives functors (or just "applicatives", for short) have been growing in popularity as a way to build applications and model certain domains over the last decade or so, since McBride and Paterson published [Applicative Programming with Effects](http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.html). Applicatives are now reaching a level of popularity within the community that supporting them with a convenient and readable syntax, as we do for monads, is beginning to make sense.

## Why Applicatives?

_Applicative functors_ sit, in terms of power, somewhere between _functors_ (i.e. types which support `Map`), and _monads_ (i.e. types which support `Bind`). 

If we consider `Bind : M<'T> * ('T -> M<'U>) -> M<'U>`, we can see that the second element of the input is a function that requires a value to create the resulting "wrapped value".

In contrast, `Apply : M<'T -> 'U> * M<'T> -> M<'U>` only needs a wrapped function, which is something we have whilst building our computation.

So, importantly, applicatives allow us the power to use functions which are "wrapped up" inside a functor, but [preserve our ability to analyse the structure of the computation](https://paolocapriotti.com/assets/applicative.pdf) - and hence introduce optimisations or alternative interpretations - without any values present. This is a critical distinction which can have a huge impact on performance, and indeed on what is possible to construct at all, so has very pragmatic implications. 

## Examples of Useful Applicatives

The examples below all make use of types which are applicatives, but explicitly _not_ monads, to allow a powerful model for building a particular kind of computation, whilst preserving enough constraints to offer useful guarantees.

[Tomas Petricek's formlets blog post](http://tomasp.net/blog/formlets-in-linq.aspx/) introduces the idea that we can use applicatives to build web forms. The guarantee of a static structure of the formlet applicative is used to render forms, but its powerful behaviours still allow useful processing of requests.

[Pauan's comment about Observables](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/579#issuecomment-310799948) points out that applicatives allow us to avoid frequent resubscriptions to Observable values because we know precisely how they'll be hooked up ahead of time.

[McBride & Paterson's paper](http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.html) introduces a type very much like F#'s `Result<'T,'TError>` which can be used to stitch together functions and values which might fail, but conveniently accumulating up all of the errors which can then be helpfully presented at once, as opposed to immediately presenting the first error. This allows you to take [Scott Wlaschin's Railway Oriented Programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) to the next level!

[Capriotti & Kaposi's paper](https://paolocapriotti.com/assets/applicative.pdf) introduce an example of creating an command line argument parser, where a single applicative can both statically generate help text for the parser, and dynamically parse options given to an application.

More advanced usages include self-adjusting compuations, such as [Jane Street's Incremental](https://blog.janestreet.com/introducing-incremental/), but with even greater opportunity for efficiencies via the careful balance of power and guarantees that applicatives give (such as the ability to more efficiently organise the computation, and avoid recreating the rest of the computation everytime a `Bind` is reached).

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

This RFC introduces a desugaring for applicative computation expressions, much like that which exists for monads and related constructs.

Example desugaring:

```fsharp
ce {
    let! x = foo
    and! y = bar
    and! z = baz
    return x + y + z
 }
```
⇒
```
ce.Apply(
    ce.Apply(
        ce.Apply(
            ce.Return(
                (fun x ->
                    (fun y ->
                        (fun z ->
                            x + y + z
                        )
                    )
                )),
            foo),
        bar), 
    baz)
```

To be accepted as an applicative computation expression (CE), the CE must be of the form `let! ... and! ... and! ... return ...`. This means, for example, no `let!`s after an `and!` in the same CE, no normal `let`s inbetween the `let!` and `and!`s, and no usages of `yield` in place of `return`.

This may sound very constrained, but it is for good reason. The structure imposed by this rule forces the CE to be in a canonical form ([McBride & Paterson](http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.html)):

> Any expression built from the Applicative combinators can be transformed
to a canonical form in which a single pure function is ‘applied’ to the effectful parts
in depth-first order:  
`pure f <*> arg1 <*> ... <*> argN`  
This canonical form captures the essence of Applicative programming: computations
have a fixed structure, given by the pure function, and a sequence of subcomputations,
given by the effectful arguments.

In our case, the expression to the right of `return` (i.e. `pure`) becomes the body of a lambda, whose parameters are introduced by the `let! ... and! ...` preceeding it. This leads to a very straightforward desugaring of the syntax, which therefore ensures using, understanding and debugging the feature is only as complex as is inherently required by the abstraction.

Despite requiring the canonical form, there are still many ways to build more complex and useful expressions from this syntax. The rest of this section aims to give a tour around these various features.

## Pattern Matching

```fsharp
let (|Quad|) (i : int) =
    i * i * i * i

type SingleCaseDu<'a> = SingleCaseDu of 'a

ce {
    let! Quad(x)          = foo
    and! (y,_)            = bar
    and! (SingleCaseDu z) = baz
    return x + y + z
 }
```
⇒
```fsharp
ce.Apply(
    ce.Apply(
        ce.Apply(
            ce.Return(
                (fun Quad(x) ->
                    (fun (y,_) ->
                        (fun (SingleCaseDu z) ->
                            x + y + z
                        )
                    )
                )),
            foo),
        bar), 
    baz)
```

Pattern matching on the left-hand side of of a `let! ... and! ...` binding is valid, and desugars into the same pattern, but now as part of the lambda corresponding to that binding.

## Using Monadic and Applicative Styles Simultaneously

Recall that `let! ... and! ... return ...` syntax precludes an additional `let!` anywhere in the CE. In the case where your applicative happens also to be a monad, and you want to leverage the benefits of an applicative in some places (e.g. for performance reasons) but also use a `let!` (e.g. for convenience, or to do something a pure applicative doesn't support), you must do so inside a different CE context, e.g.:

```fsharp
ce {
    let! quux =
        ce {
            let! x                = foo
            and! (y,_)            = bar
            and! (SingleCaseDu z) = baz
            return x + y + z
        }
    if quux > 6
    then 
        return quux
    else
        return 5
}
```
⇒
```fsharp
ce.Bind(
    ce.Apply(
        ce.Apply(
            ce.Apply(
                ce.Return(
                    (fun x ->
                        (fun (y,_) ->
                            (fun (SingleCaseDu z) ->
                                x + y + z
                            )
                        )
                    )),
                foo),
            bar), 
        baz),
    (fun quux ->
        if quux > 6
        then
            return quux
        else
            return 5)
)
```

## Monoids

The existing `let!` CE syntax allows us to use `Combine` (typically in conjunction with `yield`) to define monad plus instances (i.e. also interpret the type as a monoid). [Just as monad plus is to a monad, alternatives are to applicatives](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Alternative_and_MonadPlus), so we can do a similar thing for our applicative CE syntax. One motivation for this might be the command line argument example from earlier, where alternatives allow parsing discriminated unions in a way that translates to something akin to "try this case, else try this case, else try this case, ...".

One might assume that the syntax would be something such as:
```fsharp
ce {
    let! x = foo
    and! y = bar
    and! z = baz
    yield x + y + z
    yield x + y
    yield y + z
 }
```
Unfortunately, the naive implementation can make it very easily possible to build a CE which unintentionally desugars to be very large:
```
ce.Combine(
    ce.Combine(
        ce.Apply(
            ce.Apply(
                ce.Apply(
                    ce.Return(
                        (fun x ->
                            (fun y ->
                                (fun z ->
                                    x + y + z
                                )
                            )
                        )),
                    foo),
                bar), 
            baz),
        ce.Apply(
            ce.Apply(
                ce.Apply(
                    ce.Return(
                        (fun x ->
                            (fun y ->
                                (fun z ->
                                    x + y
                                )
                            )
                        )),
                    foo),
                bar), 
            baz)
    ),
    ce.Apply(
        ce.Apply(
            ce.Apply(
                ce.Return(
                    (fun x ->
                        (fun y ->
                            (fun z ->
                                y + z
                            )
                        )
                    )),
                foo),
            bar), 
        baz)
)
```
*N.B.* How the size of the desugared expression grows with the product of the number of bindings introduced by the `let! ... and! ...` syntax and the number calls to `Combine` implied by the alternative cases.

An attempt at a very smart desugaring which tries to cut down the resulting expression might, on the face of it, seem like a reasonable option, however, beyond the cost of analysing which values which are introduced by `let! ... and! ...` actually go on to be used, we must also consider the right-hand sides of the `let! ... and! ...` bindings and the pattern matching: Do we do these once up front? Or redo them in each alternative case at the leaf of the tree of calls to `Combine`? What if the expressions on the right-hand sides have side-effects, or the left-hand side utilised active patterns with side-effects? At that point we either make complex, uninutive rules, or force the CE writer to be explicit. Continuing in the spirit of CEs generally being straightforward desugarings, we choose the latter make make the writer clearly state their desire.

In order to keep things simple, then, we keep the canonical form introduced earlier, which forces precisely one `return` after a `let! ... and! ...`. However, we can still express alternative applicatives when using the `let! ... and! ...` syntax. We just need to use the same trick as with additional `let!`s and leave the scope of the canonical applicative syntax and therefore leave the additional contraints it places on us:
```fsharp
ce {
    yield
        ce {
            let! x = foo
            and! y = bar
            and! z = baz
            return x + y + z
        }
    yield
        ce {
            let! x = foo
            and! y = bar
            return x + y
        }
    yield
        ce {
            let! x = foo
            and! y = bar
            return y + z
        }
}
```
⇒
```
ce.Combine(
    ce.Combine(
        ce.Apply(
            ce.Apply(
                ce.Apply(
                    ce.Return(
                        (fun x ->
                            (fun y ->
                                (fun z ->
                                    x + y + z
                                )
                            )
                        )),
                    foo),
                bar), 
            baz),
        ce.Apply(
            ce.Apply(
                ce.Return(
                    (fun x ->
                        (fun y ->
                            x + y
                        )
                    )),
                foo),
            bar)
    ),
    ce.Apply(
        ce.Apply(
            ce.Return(
                (fun y ->
                    (fun z ->
                        y + z
                    )
                )),
            bar),
        baz)
)
```
*N.B.* How this syntax forces the writer to be explicit about how many times `Apply` should be called, and with which arguments, for each call to `Combine`. Notice also how the right-hand sides are still repeated for each alternative case in order to keep the occurance of potential side-effects from evaluating them predictable, and also occur before the pattern matching _each time_ a new alternative case is explored.

## Using

Just as monads support `Using` via `use!`, applicatives supports it via `use! ... anduse! ...`. Each binding can being either `and!` or `anduse!` (unless it is the first, in which case it must be either `let!` or `use!`), i.e. you can mix-and-match to describe which bindings should be covered by a call to `Using`:
```fsharp
ce {
     use! x    = foo // x is wrapped in a call to ce.Using(...)
     and! y    = bar // y is _not_ wrapped in a call to ce.Using(...)
     anduse! z = baz // z is wrapped in a call to ce.Using(...)
     return x + y + z
 }
```
⇒
```fsharp
ce.Apply(
    ce.Apply(
        ce.Apply(
            ce.Return(
                (fun x ->
                    ce.Using(x, fun x ->
                        // N.B. No ce.Using(...) call here because we used `and!` instead of `anduse!` for `y` in the CE
                        (fun y ->
                            (fun z ->
                                ce.Using(z, fun z ->
                                    x + y + z
                                )
                            )
                        )
                    )
                )),
            foo), 
        bar),
    baz)
```

## Ambiguities surrounding a `let! .. return ...`
[single-let]: #single-let

Some CEs could be validly desugared in multiple ways, depending on which methods are implemented on a builder (assuming the implementations follow the standard laws relating these functions).

For example:
```fsharp
ce {
    let! x = foo
    return x + 1
 }
```

Can be desugared via `Bind`:
```fsharp
ce.Bind(
    (fun x -> ce.Return(x + 1)),
    foo)
```

Or via `Apply`:
```fsharp
ce.Apply(
    ce.Return(fun x -> x + 1),
    foo)
```

This is because the operation is really equivalent to a `Map`, something which can be implemented in terms of `Return` and either `Bind` or `Apply`. We mentioned that these functions were in some sense more powerful than a plain functor's `Map`, and we are seeing an example of that here. 

In order to avoid breaking backwards compatability, the default resolution is to desugar via `Bind` failing if it is not defined on the builder. This is consistent with in previous F# versions. [Later work on supporting `Map`](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/master/RFCs/FS-1048-ce-builder-map.md) can then make the choice about how to resolve this in a way which works with that in mind too.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

The new applicative compuation expressions are quite constrainted, and as has been discussed, that is precisely what allows them to be so useful. However, these constraints are potentially somewhat unintuitive to the beginner. Computation expressions already involve one of the steeper learning curves of the F# language features, so the added complexity from this feature needs to be carefully weighed against the potential guarantees, expressiveness and performance gains that they can offer.

# Alternative Designs
[alternative-designs]: #alternative-designs

[Tomas Petricek's Joinads](http://tomasp.net/blog/fsharp-variations-joinads.aspx/) offered a superset of the features proposed here, but was [rejected](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/172) due to its complexity. This RFC is of much smaller scope, so should be a much less risky change.

# Compatibility
[compatibility]: #compatibility

## Is this a breaking change?
Code previously accepted by the compiler should continue to be accepted and produce the same result. See [the discussion of `let! ... return ...`](#single-let) computation expressions for how this is achieved.

## What happens when previous versions of the F# compiler encounter this design addition as source code?

TODO: Try this!

## What happens when previous versions of the F# compiler encounter this design addition in compiled binaries?

Since the syntax is desugared into a method call on the builder object, after compilation usages of this feature will be usable with previous compiler versions.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

`use! ... anduse! ...` needs to be implemented in order to flesh out any issues there. There's also the question as to whether `anduse!` is an acceptable keyword.

Should the RFC for desugaring `let! ... return ...` via one of `Map`, `Apply` or `Bind`:
* Be decided in this RFC, potentially impacting the existing RFC for desugaring to `Map`
* Be left to that RFC (which would then also have to start considering `Apply` as well as `Bind`)?

And if the former:
* Break backwards compatibility and use `Apply` as the desugaring if and only if `Bind` is not defined (and similarly for `Map` and `Apply`, and `Map` and `Bind`), leaving room for later language changes to introduce attributes or similar to allow the decision to be made on a builder-by-builder basis?
* _Prefer_ `Apply` if it is defined, on the basis that any reasonable `Apply` implementation will be functionally equivalent, but more efficient than the corresponding `Bind`?
